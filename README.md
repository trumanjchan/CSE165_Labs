## Lab 2
Player vs. Player mode was 90% successful. I should have included the code where after a player wins, no one can move anymore and the next option would be to restart the game using SPACEBAR. I made a failed attempt at creating the Player vs. AI mode (activate this mode with ENTER key).

## Lab 3
Two rectangles on the scene. When a rectangle one is clicked, it is brought forth and highlighted. If you hold MOUSE1 on the bottom right corner of the selected rectangle, you can resize it!

***freeglutapp*** is the non-OOP template, and ***glutapp_template*** is the required template for the Lab 5 submission. Choose to run one at a time, in your terminal, by using command *cd Lab5* followed by *cd freeglutapp* OR *cd glutapp_template*. Then do command *make* followed by *./glutapp*.<br />

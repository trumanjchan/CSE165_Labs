# CSE165_Labs

Lab 1
-
Used GL_POLYGON to write my name out in OpenGL. Run with 'make' then './glutapp'


Lab 4
-
A copy of MS Paint. Run with 'make' then './glutapp'


Lab 5
-
freeglutapp is the non-OOP template, and glutapp_template is the required template for the Lab 5 submission. Choose to open either one of the folders in VSCode, and in your terminal, type 'make', then './glutapp'. Both have an enemy rectangle and player rectangle. WASD for movement. Holding SPACEBAR shoots a projectile. There is collision detection that detects when the player has slain the enemy and if the player has touched the enemy.
